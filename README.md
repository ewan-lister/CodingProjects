## Machine Learning

My current machine learning projects are composed in the README.md - report format, such that others can reproduce the results, draw inspiration, and learn from the techniques I explore. Credit is due to J. Nathan Kutz for his excellent instruction in Machine Learning, as well as guiding these reports.
