    "**A.** Read in the trombone sound file provided and name it tr_orig.  This is a mono signal, so we will only need to worry about the single channel. Create a noise sequence that is the length of tr_orig using the numpy.random.randn() noise generation function with a scaling factor of 100. (It needs to be larger to be audible given the range of tr_orig.) Then add the two signals to create tr_noisy.  Save tr_noisy to a new wav file.\n",

    "## Assignment 4 -- Convolution with Images\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is meant to introduce you to convolution of signals in higher dimensions. A canonical example of a 2D signal is an image. With a time signal, the impulse response has a single independent variable (time), so a discrete-time convolution has a sum over that variable. With a 2-D image, the impulse response is 2-D, so the convolution involves a double sum. Be sure to import the scipy ndimage and skimage color packages. This assignment will have four parts, A-D. Put part A (a function you will define) in its own cell and the other parts together in a separate cell. Be sure to provide a title for all the images you are plotting in each part.\n",

    "**A.**  Write a function that takes an image as input and runs the Sobel edge detector (described in the background document) and returns 3 images: the horizontal edges, the vertical edges and the combined result.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**B.**  Start a new cell and read in the image of a dragonfly provided, and convert it to grayscale. Note that the variable ‘image’ will have normalized 8-bit (0 - 1) pixel brightness values. Run the edge detector function on the dragonfly image and display the original with the 3 \n",
    "outputs in a 2 by 2 figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.**  Define a 10x10 kernel where all elements have value 0.01. This impulse response is giving an average over the 10x10 window, and it should have a smoothing effect on the image, similar to the moving window for the time signal.  Convolve the image with this filter using ndimage.convolve(). Plot the original and the smoothed image side by side.  You should notice that smoothing blurs the image a little.\n",
