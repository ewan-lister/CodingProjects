    "In this lab, we will learn how to build periodic signals from component sinusoids and how to transform signals from the time domain to the frequency domain. The concepts we’ll focus on include: implementation of the Fourier Series synthesis equation, using a discrete implementation of the Fourier Transform (DFT) with a digitized signal, and understanding the relationship between the discrete DFT index k and frequency f\n",
